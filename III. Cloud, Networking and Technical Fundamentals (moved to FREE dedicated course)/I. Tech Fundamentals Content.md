# TECH FUNDAMENTALS CONTENT (!!PLEASE READ ME!!)

I've just launched a dedicated course for technical fundamentals, and it's completely **FREE** on [learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/tech-fundamentals).

If you're an experienced engineer, developer, or solutions architect, you might think you already know everything covered in the course, but trust me, there's always something new to learn. And if you're new to AWS/Cloud, these lessons are a perfect fit for youâ€”they're 100% relevant and will definitely help you build a strong foundation.

I highly encourage you to take a look at these lessons, even if you need to speed them up to 1.5x or 2x. Believe me, future-you will be grateful for investing the time to fill any knowledge gaps in basic networking, security, encryption, DNS, DNSSEC, and much more.

Even if you're an experienced engineer, it's always good to review and ensure that there are no small gaps in your knowledge. So, while this section is optional for those with extensive technical knowledge, it is highly recommended. For everyone else, it should be viewed as **mandatory**.

Trust me, you don't want to miss out on these valuable lessons. Everyone who skips them ends up regretting it.
