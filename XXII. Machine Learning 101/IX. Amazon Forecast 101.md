# Amazon Forecast

## Overview

**Amazon Forecast** is an AWS **managed service** designed for forecasting based on **time series data**. It is **not** a weather forecasting service. Instead, it is used for predicting metrics such as:

- Retail demand
- Supply chain needs
- Staffing requirements
- Energy usage
- Server capacity
- Web traffic patterns

This tool is highly relevant for time-sensitive businesses or systems that depend on trends in historical data.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Time Series Forecasting**

- **Definition:** Forecasting future values based on historical, time-indexed data.
- **Use Case Examples:**
  - How many jackets will sell in winter?
  - How many support agents are needed next month?
  - Will server traffic spike during a sale?

### 2. **Data Types Used**

#### a. **Historical Data**

- Basic form:
  ```text
  ItemID, DateTime, QuantitySold
  ```
- Used to track the pattern of items or activities over time.

#### b. **Related Data (Contextual)**

- Additional context to improve prediction accuracy.
- Examples:
  - Promotions during specific timeframes
  - Weather patterns
  - Holidays or special events

### 3. **Outputs**

Amazon Forecast provides two main outputs:

#### a. **Forecast**

- Predicts future demand/metrics based on input data.

#### b. **Explainability**

- Describes **why** the forecast changed.
- Example: If rain increases coat sales, explainability will highlight weather as a key influence.

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Import Historical Data**  
   Time-stamped records of previous performance.

2. **Import Related Data**  
   Contextual elements like events, weather, promotions.

3. **Generate Forecast**  
   Predictions on future values.

4. **Explore Explainability**  
   Understand influencing factors behind the prediction.
