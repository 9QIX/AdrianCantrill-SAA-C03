# Basic Cost Management for AWS Accounts

Welcome back! In this demo lesson, we'll cover how to manage costs within an AWS account. Specifically, we'll explore the AWS Free Tier and set up a budget to monitor your spending as you progress through the course. Although the goal is to stay within the AWS Free Tier, knowing how to effectively monitor usage is crucial.

## AWS Free Tier Overview

The AWS Free Tier offers a range of services at no cost, which is useful for learning and experimentation. Here are the main categories of Free Tier offers:

- **Free Trials**: Short-term offers for specific services.
- **12-Month Free**: Some services are free for 12 months from the date you first sign up.
- **Always Free**: Certain services are always free up to a specific allocation.

For example:

- **EC2 Instances**: 750 hours per month for the first 12 months.
- **Amazon S3**: 5 GB of standard storage.
- **Amazon RDS**: 750 hours of certain instance types.
