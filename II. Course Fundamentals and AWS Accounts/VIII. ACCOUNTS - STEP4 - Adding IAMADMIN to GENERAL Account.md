## AWS IAM Identity Setup and Security Configuration - Demo Summary

### Introduction

This lesson focuses on enhancing the security of an AWS account by creating and using an **IAM identity** with **admin permissions**. The goal is to replace the use of the account **root user** with a more secure and manageable IAM identity, as the root user is unrestricted and should not be used for regular operations.

### Step 1: Avoid Using Root User

- **Account root user** should not be used for production or day-to-day usage because:
  - It cannot be restricted or deleted.
  - It is the most privileged user in AWS, which creates a security risk.
- **Best Practice**: Upon account creation, set up a normal **admin user** with full control over the account, replacing root user usage.

### Step 2: Setting Up an IAM Admin Identity

- **Navigate to IAM**:
  - Open the AWS Management Console, search for **IAM**, and select it to open the IAM console.
- **Create Account Alias**:
  - Optionally, create a more recognizable **account alias** for the login URL, making it easier to remember and more specific to your environment.
- **Create an IAM User**:
  - Click on **Users** > **Add Users**.
  - Set the **username** as `IAM admin`.
  - Grant this user access to the AWS Management Console by selecting the appropriate checkbox.

### Step 3: Identity Center vs. IAM User

- **Identity Center vs. IAM User**:
  - AWS encourages the use of **Identity Center** for identity management. However, this demo uses an **IAM user** for hands-on experience with both methods throughout the course.

### Step 4: Set Up IAM Admin Password

- **Password Setup**:
  - Set a custom password for the `IAM admin` user.
  - Uncheck "users must create a new password at next sign-in" for convenience.
- **Permissions Assignment**:
  - Assign **Administrator Access** by attaching the corresponding policy directly to the `IAM admin` user.

### Step 5: Test IAM Admin Login

- **Sign-in URL**:
  - Copy the **sign-in URL** unique to IAM users (formatted as `https://[account-id].signin.aws.amazon.com/console`).
- **Login Process**:
  - Log out from the root user and log in using the **IAM admin** credentials.
  - Verify that the IAM admin identity has full administrative access by checking the **IAM username** in the console's top-right dropdown.

### Step 6: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Secure IAM Admin with MFA**:
  - As with the root user, secure the IAM admin account by enabling **MFA**.
  - Follow these steps:
    - Navigate to **My Security Credentials** in the dropdown.
    - Under **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, select **Assign MFA Device**.
    - Choose **Authenticator App** as the device type.
    - Scan the QR code with an authenticator app to generate a new MFA entry for this identity.
    - Input two consecutive codes from the authenticator app to finalize the setup.

### Step 7: Verify MFA Configuration

- **Log Out and Log Back In**:
  - Log out from the AWS console and log back in using the **IAM admin** identity.
  - Upon login, enter both the **password** and the **one-time code** generated by the authenticator app.

### Summary of Actions Taken

- Created a separate **IAM admin identity** within the general AWS account to replace the usage of the **root user**.
- Configured **MFA** for both the root user and IAM admin for enhanced security.
- From this point on, all operations in the AWS account should be carried out using the **IAM admin identity**, ensuring that the root user remains unused for routine tasks.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to set up and secure an IAM admin identity for a general AWS account. You can now proceed to use this identity for the rest of the course while ensuring that security best practices are followed by enabling **multi-factor authentication**.
