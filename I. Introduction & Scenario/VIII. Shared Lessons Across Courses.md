# Shared Lessons Across Courses

## Understanding Shared Lessons

Lessons tagged with labels like `[SHAREDALL]`, `[ASSOCIATESHARED]`, and `[SAAC03SHARED]` are shared across multiple courses. This tagging indicates that the content is relevant for more than one AWS Certification, and helps you make informed decisions about whether to revisit or skip these lessons.

## When to Skip or Watch Shared Lessons

- **First Course**: If this is your first course in the series, **do not skip** the shared lessons. They are crucial for building a strong foundational understanding.
- **Previous Exposure**: If you have encountered the shared lesson in another course but are not completely confident, **watch it again** to reinforce your understanding.

- **Confidence Level**: If you have already watched the lesson and feel **100% confident**, you can **skip** it to save time and focus on new content.

## Efficient Study Strategy

Utilizing shared lessons effectively allows you to cover more ground in less time. For example:

- **Associate Courses**: Instead of spending 300% of the effort on three separate associate courses, by skipping shared topics where you are already confident, you can complete the three courses in approximately 180% of the effort of just one course.

By managing your study time efficiently through shared lessons, you can maximize your learning while minimizing redundant effort.
