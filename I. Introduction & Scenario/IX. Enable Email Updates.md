## Why Enable Email Updates?

Occasionally, I send out special offers and updates about new content on the [Learn Cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) platform. These emails are infrequentâ€”usually just a few per monthâ€”and your email address will never be shared with other platforms.

To ensure you receive these updates and take advantage of special offers, follow the simple steps below. It only takes 30 seconds and is definitely worth it!

## How to Enable Email Updates
